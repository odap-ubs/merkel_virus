# Detection of Merkel cell Polyomavirus insertions from WES data
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is highly malignant neuroendocrine tumor of the skin arising from the mechanoreceptor Merker cells. It is caused by the Merkel cell Polyomavirus (MCV), a DNA virus that is detected in 75â€“89% of MCC. Normally, MCV insertions in MCC genomes were detected by PCR. Here we shown a 2-alignment-steps methodology to identify MCV+ tumors from whole exome sequencing (WES) data and using the MCV genome.
